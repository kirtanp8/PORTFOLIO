      <p>Concerts: Going to concerts and festivals are my opportunities to sing outside of my house without embarrassing myself.</p>
      <p>Sports: I enjoy watching/playing sports and binge watching TV shows, I’ll then like to discuss them.</p>
      <p>Travelling: Love travelling, there are places I have to see and looking at them on google maps just isn’t the same.</p>
