    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was introduced to Ruby back in March 2020 when someone suggested I should give it a look. I did and became intrigued, I ended up buying a Mac a week later and my coding journey pretty much took off from there!</p>
    <br />
    <p>Previously, I have been able to enjoy helping sole traders working in the entertainment and hospitality industry with their finances whilst overseeing my employer’s accounts.</p>
    <br />
    <p>However, I decided to make the decision to change career and join a coding bootcamp as I didn’t feel any excitement when doing my acca exams, I was just doing it for financial stability, however, when it comes to problem solving in tech I get a strong satisfaction seeing my desired output and it makes me want to keep learning, I'm simply addicted.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Currently looking for an opportunity as a junior frontend developer where I can learn but also help the team and company grow.
