    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was introduced to Ruby back in March 2020 when someone suggested I should give it a look. I did and became intrigued, I ended up buying a Mac a week later and my coding journey pretty much took off from there!</p>
    <br />
    <p>Previously, I have been able to enjoy helping sole traders working in the entertainment and hospitality industry with their finance related queries whilst overseeing my employerâ€™s accounts.</p>
    <br />
    <p>However, I decided to make the career change and join a coding bootcamp because I get a strong satisfaction seeing my desired output whenever I solve a problem and it just makes me want to keep learning, I'm simply addicted.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Currently looking for an opportunity as a junior frontend developer where I can learn but also help the team and company grow.
